## Intro to Vector Autoregression

Wiki:
VAR is a statistical model used to capture the relationship between multiple quantities as they change over time.
It is a type of stochastic process model that generalizes the single-variable (univariate) autoregressive model by allowing for multivariate time series.
VAR models are often used in economics and the natural sciences.
